So I made a decision to act ethically and not be a silent bystander at work.
Reading these two recent articles gave me some hope that the change is starting I look forward to seeing the shift and working through the shift in the near future.
These policies may be different in any company, so I must learn not to assume and to always ask for clarification, reference and reasons for the actions I am expected to take.
I understand that I could do nothing in this situation because I had handled the tasks that I had been trained in, however I felt that if I knew more I would have been more help and the situation would not have gotten so out of hand.
In order to understand how to handle responsibility I must first be confident in my role and in order to do this I have to learn off my team members and be trained in my tasks before being assigned such responsibility.
In the future it would be beneficial for me to sit with them and take notes on how they completed the task as this would mean that I am still taking responsibility for my role by learning how to face the challenge next time it occurred.
As a result my future action will be to meet difficult situations and learn from my team members on how they approach the challenging task.
I will develop goals for myself during the week so that each week I have learnt a new skill and can comfortably complete the task and take responsibility for the way it unfolds, whether it be positively or whether it results in complaints.
I will also confront my team leader the next time I feel that I have been assigned a task I do not feel confident in and will request further training in order to be able to successfully hold responsibility and maintain team efficiency in the future.
