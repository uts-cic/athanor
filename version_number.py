# The version/release/level numbers in this file are automatically adjusted 
# by version_athanor.py after it builds a new atanor.jar
# it can also be updated manually, according to these rules:
# 1) The version/release/level numbers must be 0 or 
# 2) must match the latest atanor_version.release.level.jar in the java/dist 
#    library.
# older versioned jars can be deleted, and the numbers can have gaps. 
# 
#
# The atanor_cpp_version is appended temporarily to this file during the invocation 
# of the build, but is not maintained in this file.
